# Data Preprocessing

This repository contains code for a lab assignment on data preprocessing. The code includes basic and common features of data preprocessing such as filtering missing values, removing outliers, and using one-hot encoding.

## Features

- **Filter missing values**: This feature allows you to remove rows or columns with missing values from your dataset.

- **Remove outliers**: This feature helps you identify and remove outliers from your dataset to improve the accuracy of your analysis.

- **One-hot encoding**: This feature converts categorical variables into a format that can be used in machine learning algorithms.
